# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
  It was a great experience configuring software for week 0. In this journal, i am going to take you through the different steps that was required for kick off for the development of the Cruddur App.
  
## Installing aws CLI on Gitpod
The following steps are required:
- Create an account on the Gitpod website, 
- Download the Gitpod plugin for firefox in order to have a shortcut directly from our github repo
- Search installation procedures for aws cli on [aws website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), 
	Installation for linux
```
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```

## Architectural(logical) diagram 
Using lucid chart, i was able to draw the [Architectural diagram](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/03ee2229-051a-412f-9160-2cd58e979b68/edit?viewport_loc=-558%2C-1110%2C2560%2C1202%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_04c7852e-ddc7-43bd-b19c-d287c0236caa) of the Cruddur App to be built
